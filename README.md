# smartphoneDupe

I used this project to learn object oriented programming through Python. 

I created a class called "Smartphone" with functions that allow a user to add an app, remove an app, and access a report of the apps on the Smartphone. The user is able to give a name to their Smartphone and determine its capacity.
